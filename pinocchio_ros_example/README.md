# Pinocchio ROS/catkin example

This example demonstrates how to use Pinocchio in a catkin package. Pinocchio is released as a 3rd-party CMake package into ROS Kinetic, Melodic, and Noetic and can be installed using `sudo apt install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-pinocchio`.

To find Pinocchio:
```cmake
find_package(pinocchio REQUIRED)
```

and use:
```cmake
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} pinocchio::pinocchio)
```

This example is built on GitHub Actions for Melodic and Noetic.

## Include order

When including a ROS header, e.g. `ros/ros.h`, compilation errors may occur. This is due to different requirements for `BOOST_MPL_LIMIT_LIST_SIZE` between ROS and Pinocchio. To avoid this error, make sure to always include `pinocchio/fwd.hpp` _before any other header_.
